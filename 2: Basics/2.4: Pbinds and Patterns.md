# Pbinds and Patterns

---------------------------

- What Patterns are
- SynthDef writing for ProxySpace patterns, a deconstruction
    - The default arguments and how they plug into SynthDefs
- 'dur' is your friend, how to manage it. This is not TidalCycles.
- How to use them directly on top of proxyspace
- Why I find Pdefs quite bulky
- Tdefs (test these too)
- Some of my favourite pattern classes
- I'll be using these in the 'Rhythm' section

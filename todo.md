# A list of techniques, subjects, etc I haven't yet covered

I'll be listing these by musical content, as i approached live coding as a musician

- Rhythm
    - Rhythmic Construction
	- Pbinds on Pbinds, Why I find Pdefs a bit bulky, Also Tdefs
    - Pbinds straight onto proxyspace
    - Pbinds alongside static synths
    - A set of my favourite pattern classes
    - Euclidean Rhythms and the Bjorklund quark
        - Euclidean 3 vs straight 4/4 kick
        - Footworking with offsets
        - Constrained randomness and euclidean rhythms
        - Easy Convergence/Divergence using a common value set
        - Euclidean rhythms for percussion
        - Euclidean rhythms for Melody

- Pitch/Melody
    - Pbinds and melodic/pitch arrangement
    - Good SynthDef writing practice for co34pt_livecode
    - Simple scales
	- Not so simple scales (53 note ET as a way to smear pitch)
	- Harmonic series and modulating harmonic series
    - Also abuse of pitch/pitch-glitches
	- Operating between pitch and noise (henon, sinoscFB)
    - Chaos synths
            - I have _no_ idea how they work but they sound good
            - My use of Henon and constrained randomness

- Things that don't have a place yet...
    - Static synths
        - Chaning static synths
        - Feedback
        - SuperCollider as a live-codable modular synth that doesn't cost £££
    -  StageLimiter, and StageLimiter abuse

-  Visuals
    - Dropping the scope behind the IDE on linux = instant visuals. Don't know how to do it on any other platform ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

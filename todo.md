# A list of techniques, subjects, etc I haven't yet covered


- Field recordings!

## Other miscellaneous things I need to do:

- Proofread the entire repo
- Update contents page and write introductory page better, current one isn't great
- Some of the examples on the gh-pages site have bizarre or incorrect syntax highlighting, figure out why this is
- suggestion from datamads - talk about .asStream in Euclidean Rhythms
- talk about proxymixer

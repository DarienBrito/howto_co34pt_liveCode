# A list of techniques, subjects, etc I haven't yet covered

- Do we need Pitch and Static Synths - can go into Non-Pattern techniques - yes we probably do tbh, but they maybe don't need to go into their own section?

- Field recordings!

## Other miscellaneous things I need to do:

- Document or guide or something to explain the format of the repository, both to those who clone is via github and those who visit the gh-pages site.
- Update contents page and write introductory page better, current on
- Some of the examples on the gh-pages site have bizarre or incorrect syntax highlighting, figure out why this is
- SynthDefs need annotation, so that Good SynthDef Writing can be written
- suggestion from datamads - talk about .asStream in Euclidean Rhythms
- talk about proxymixer

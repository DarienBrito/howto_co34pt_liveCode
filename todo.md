# A list of techniques, subjects, etc I haven't yet covered

- Why Live Coding? (Covered in an earlier text)
- Why SuperCollider?
- Proxyspace as the fundamental foundation for literally all live coding i do ever, and why it is so cool.
- Recommended (read: essential) addons
   - ddwSnippets
   - BatLib
   - BenoitLib
   - Bjorklund
   - sc3-plugins
   - JITLibExtensions
   - Feedback (sometimes)
- Boilerplate code, loading samples, setting initial parameters
    - Copyleft samples i'm using and who I need to attribute
- StageLimiter, and StageLimiter abuse
- Pbinds
    - How I use Pbinds
        - The SynthDefs I use inside of Pbinds (bplay, henon etc)
	- Good SynthDef writing practice for co34pt_livecode
	- Pbinds on Pbinds, Why I find Pdefs a bit bulky, Also Tdefs
    - Pbinds straight onto proxyspace
    - Pbinds alongside static synths
    - A set of my favourite pattern classes
    - Pkr and synchronising values outside of patterns
    - Pbinds for Percussion/Melody
- Static synths
    - Chaning static synths
    - Feedback
    - SuperCollider as a live-codable modular synth that doesn't cost £££
- Euclidean Rhythms and the Bjorklund quark
    - Euclidean 3 vs straight 4/4 kick
    - Footworking with offsets
    - Constrained randomness and euclidean rhythms
    - Easy Convergence/Divergence using a common value set
    - Euclidean rhythms for percussion
    - Euclidean rhythms for Melody
- Chaos synths
    - I have _no_ idea how they work but they sound good
    - My use of Henon and constrained randomness

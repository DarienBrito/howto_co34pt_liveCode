# A list of techniques, subjects, etc I haven't yet covered

- Rhythm
    - A set of my favourite pattern classes ++ I've decided i'm not going to do this so instead i need to grep all of the files i've written to check that i'm not going to allude to the fact that i have written this at any point

## Other miscellaneous things I need to do:

- Document or guide or something to explain the format of the repository, both to those who clone is via github and those who visit the gh-pages site.
- Come up with a better name for 'static synths', because that's not what they are.

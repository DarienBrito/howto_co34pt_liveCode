# A list of techniques, subjects, etc I haven't yet covered

- Rhythm
    - A set of my favourite pattern classes ++ I've decided I'm not going to do this so instead I need to grep all of the files I've written to check that i'm not going to allude to the fact that I have written this at any point
    - Do 3.3 and 3.4 need to be seperate? Maybe 3.3.1 could be various techniques for rhythm and 3.3.2 could be the basic rhythms modified by those techniques, or maybe 3.4 could be eschewed totally. What this seems to do is to skew the balance overall toward the more complex rhythmic techniques simply because there is more sections about them, but i'm not sure if that is necessarily an issue
- Do we need Pitch and Static Synths - can go into Non-Pattern techniques - yes we probably do tbh, but they maybe don't need to go into their own section?

- Field recordings!

## Other miscellaneous things I need to do:

- Document or guide or something to explain the format of the repository, both to those who clone is via github and those who visit the gh-pages site.
- Come up with a better name for 'static synths', because that's not what they are.
- Update contents page and write introductory page better, current one has no face
- Some of the examples on the gh-pages site have bizarre or incorrect syntax highlighting, figure out why this is
- SynthDefs need annotation, so that Good SynthDef Writing can be written

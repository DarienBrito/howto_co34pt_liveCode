# howto_co34pt_liveCode

-----------------

A repository of readmes, techniques, samples, files notes and other materials about how I live code in SuperCollider. A (sorta) companion repository to co34pt_livecode.

This is currently mostly finished, but does need proofreading, which I will be doing soon.

If you are reading this online, there is also a GitHub repository [here](github.com/theseanco/howto_co34pt_liveCode)

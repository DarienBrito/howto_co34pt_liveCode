# Techniques for Modifying Rhythm

======

In 3.2 I went over a few basic rhythmic units for some simple dance music rhythms, here I will elaborate on a few of the more simple techniques I use to get a bit of complexity in my rhythms.

### Why I don't use (total) randomness

The [Pwhite](TODO) class is a great way to incorporate randomness into patterns, and one of the first things I tried to do when adding complexity to rhythms was to simply randomise them, however the results were often quite disappointing, especially with multiple random rhythms played at once for sounds that are played regularly (i.e. snares, hats):

```supercollider
TODO: Shit examples of random rhythms
```

With rhythms that use random floating point numbers, the durations that are used have no relationship to any central pulse, and will end up cutting across the beat a lot of the time in a way that I feel does not make sense in dance music. Instead, randomness can be incorporated within various techniques (for a great example see the way that Pwhite is used in the section on Euclidean Rhythms), or constrained to fit within a more regular pattern by using methods (which can be found in the [Pattern Documentation](TODO)).

Here is an example of using methods to constrain Pwhite into a form that is more palatable:

```supercollider
TODO: constrained randomness
```

Pwhite also only gives floating point results if one of the values specified is a floating point number, so for quick whole-beat durations (especially useful for occasional longer sounds) I use Pwhite to generate whole beats:

```supercollider
TODO: whole note randomness
```

### Layering

Some great advice I received from a lecturer was 'if one of them is good, lots of them will be great' (paraphrased), when talking about the work of [an artist](TODO: Who is this again?). This works really well when applied to rhythmic percussion, particularly if each layer of similar percussion serves to re-contextualise the last.

Take the 'polyrhythmic clap' in 3.3, when juxtaposed against another rhythm the two work to augment each other:

```supercollider
TODO: the polyrhythmic clap works very well against a (3,8)
```

When I'm layering rhythms, there are generally a few techniques I employ to make doing so 'work':

- Layer at different pitches:
```supercollider
TODO: layering at different pitches
```
- Layer very slightly different rhythms, rhythmic units of different lengths
```supercollider
TODO: Layering at slightly different rhythms, lengths
```
- Layer interlocking or complimentary rhythms
```supercollider
TODO: layering rhythms
```
- Link with StageLimiter to establish rhythms underneath other ones (more on this in the StageLimiter Abuse section)
```supercollider
TODO: StageLimiter throttling of rhythmic parts
```
TODO: is there any more of these?

### Pwrand - Weighted distribution and hassle-free 

A technique that I started using after being inspired by Trap instrumentals (such as Ace Hood's [Bugatti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2KF2JbrQ94)) was hi-hats that snapped between 1/4, 1/8, 1/6 and 1/16th note patterns. The best way I found to do this was to use [Pwrand](TODO: this). Pwrand takes an array of items, and will select those items randomly within a weighted distribution, allowing control over the frequency of occurrence of particular elements.

The trap hi-hats looked like this:
```supercollider
TODO: Trap hi-hats
```

Pwrand is great to use whenever you want to control the occurrence of particular types of rhythm without explicitly specifying an order for these types of rhythm to occur. A one I've used quite a lot is to inject some variety into kick drums by switching out a straight `dur` of 1 with other values

```supercollider
TODO: a straight kick that occasionally varies
```

### Clipped percussion - stuttering

The SynthDef `vplay` is designed to deliver samples controlled by an envelope which by default is a square - it will abruptly start and stop sample playback according to envelope settings:

```supercollider
TODO: basic example of cut-off samples
```

This is a useful technique for creating sputtering rhythms out of much longer sound effects or samples, which can be chopped up on-the-fly and recombined around a central rhythm with `vplay`. This approach tends to yield interesting results by each individual sample playback taking on irregular characteristics even when played inside a regular rhythm - complexity with minimal effort:

```supercollider
TODO: Sputtery longer percussion
```

### Back-and-forth - Pkey and linking values

[Pkey](TODO: this) is a pattern class used to embed the same value multiple times in the same pattern - for example if the release value of a SynthDef needed to be the same as the duration of the note:

```supercollider
Pbind(\instrument,\something,\dur,Pseq([2,3,4,5],inf),\rel,Pkey(\dur))
```

One way to use this in rhythm is to create sample playback that flips back and forth. Due to how the [`bplay`](TODO: This) Ugen works, if a buffer is to be played backwards it will need to be started just before the end of the sample as the Synth will release once the sample is finished (for more information see [Ugen done-actions](TODO: this)). Using the `.linlin` linear scaling method this value can then be scaled into the rate of playback to create a back-and-forth pattern in percussion, shown here on a snare:

```supercollider
TODO: back-and-forth snare
```

### .normalizeSum and 'keeping it on 1'

Sometimes greater granularity or oddities of rhythm are needed, but still within the confines of some kind of regularity. This can be achieved with the `.normalizeSum` method, which will take an array and normalize all of its elements so that they add up to 1, for example `[10,20,30].normalizeSum` will produce the array `[ 0.16666666666667, 0.33333333333333, 0.5 ]`. This can be used to create arrays inside of `Pseq` that can easily create complex rhythmic bursts that still resolve around the central beat. Particularly useful here is to generate a sequential array and normalize it to create a rhythmic spread:

```supercollider
TODO: Normalizesum and (1..10) method. Also show how this can be multiplied
```

### \stretch

Another option for rhythmic variation is to use the `\stretch` argument built in to `Pbind`. This argument will multiply the `\dur` argument by `\stretch` to create a final duration which will be used in the pattern. I don't use this too much as it stands (April 2017), but it can be used super effectively

```supercollider
TODO: this
````

- Keeping 'in time' - things generally at this stage have to resolve themselves around quarter-note patterns

- Constrained Pwhite to specific rhythmic values even though it's a bit boring and why Pwhite unconstrained doesn't really work.
- Pwrand to switch between rhythmic values
- Pbinds alongside Static Synths (see section 5.x)
- There are definitely more of these, and i need to think of them before I write this section

- 4/4 kick vs (3,8) kick vs Pwrand(0.75,1.5).round(0.25) kick
- Multiple pitched kicks - AKA Layering _everything_
- Hihats going between 0.25/0.125/(0.125/2) - 1/4 1/8 1/16 patterns
- Snare going back-forward etc
- Polyrhythmic clap directly against (3,8) clap
- Random rhythms are boring. Constrained random rhythms are okay
- Using Pwrand for weighted rhythmic distribution
- Keeping 'in time' - things generally have to resolve in quarter-note patterns


#### old points:

- Constrained randomness (Pwhite with a round on it)
- The problems I had when thinking about rhythm early on in learning to live code
- Non-random (constrained to time)
- Moving in and out of time
- Minimum amount of time
- 'rhythmic sets'
- How I use particular types of percussion

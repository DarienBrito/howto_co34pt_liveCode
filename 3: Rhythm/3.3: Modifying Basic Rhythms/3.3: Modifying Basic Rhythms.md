- Constrained randomness (Pwhite with a round on it)
- Using Pwrand for weighted rhythmic distribution
- The problems I had when thinking about rhythm early on in learning to live code
- Non-random (constrained to time)
- Moving in and out of time
- Minimum amount of time
- 'rhythmic sets'
- How I use particular types of percussion

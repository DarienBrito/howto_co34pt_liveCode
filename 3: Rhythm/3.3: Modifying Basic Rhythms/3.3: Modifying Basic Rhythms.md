# Modifying Basic Rhythms


#### Newer Points

- 4/4 kick vs (3,8) kick vs Pwrand(0.75,1.5).round(0.25) kick
- Multiple pitched kicks
- Hihats going between 0.25/0.125/(0.125/2) - 1/4 1/8 1/16 patterns
- Snare going back-forward etc
- Polyrhythmic clap directly against (3,8) clap
- Random rhythms are boring. Constrained random rhythms are okay
- Using Pwrand for weighted rhythmic distribution
- Keeping 'in time' - things generally have to resolve in quarter-note patterns


#### old points:

- Constrained randomness (Pwhite with a round on it)
- The problems I had when thinking about rhythm early on in learning to live code
- Non-random (constrained to time)
- Moving in and out of time
- Minimum amount of time
- 'rhythmic sets'
- How I use particular types of percussion

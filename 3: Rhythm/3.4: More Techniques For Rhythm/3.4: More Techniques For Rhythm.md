# More techniques for Rhythm

======

- Constrained Pwhite to specific rhythmic values even though it's a bit boring and why Pwhite unconstrained doesn't really work.
- Pwrand to switch between rhythmic values
- Pbinds alongside Static Synths (see section 5.x)
- There are definitely more of these, and i need to think of them before I write this section

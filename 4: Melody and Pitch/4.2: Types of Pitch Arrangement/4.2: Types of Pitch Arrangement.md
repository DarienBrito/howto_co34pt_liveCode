### Major/Minor scales

The bedrock of the western musical canon is major and minor scales. Generally it's taught in British music education that the major scale is a '[happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=49&v=TAgresBrfcc)' sound and the minor scale is a '[serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOk8Tm815lE)' or '[sad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIuotFZnBtk)'. Generally though Minor tends to be used in most music I hear on a day-to-day basis, so if I'm going to be drawing on standard musical scale I will use that. For information on what they are from a music theory perspective check [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_and_minor). 

A few good chords to use that will work with the Major and Minor scale very well at any point will be the following:
```supercollider
TODO: Chords I, IV, V, (ii)
TODO: Explain why these envelopes are long.
```
The chords I, IV and V are fundamental parts of the vast majority of chord progressions in major or minor scales, with chord ii also being very common. If you randomly play these four chords over a random melody of the same (major/minor) scale, it'll sound _pretty_ good:
```supercollider
TODO: slow chords over random melody
```

### ChordSymbol - chord notation in SuperCollider

If you have a specific set of chords you would like to play using Patterns, the [ChordSymbol addon](https://github.com/triss/ChordSymbol) by triss is a great way to do this, with the chords in arrays I specified in the previous section replaced by a dictionary of chord names, which are automatically translated into their note values. This is very useful if you're working with an instrumentalist and you're not too quick in translating numbers to named chords (which I am not)

### Chromatic Scales

### Microtonal scales

SuperCollider has a bunch of built-in scales (which can be found by evaluating `Scale.directory`), 

### Alternative tunings

SuperCollider also has a bunch of built-in tunings (which can be found by evaluating `Tuning.directory`). These are specified as part of the `scale` argument.

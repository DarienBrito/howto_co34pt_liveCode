# Types of Pitch Arrangement

### Major/Minor scales

The bedrock of the western musical canon is major and minor scales. Generally it's taught in British music education that the major scale is a '[happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=49&v=TAgresBrfcc)' sound and the minor scale is a '[serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOk8Tm815lE)' or '[sad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIuotFZnBtk)'. Generally though Minor tends to be used in most music I hear on a day-to-day basis, so if I'm going to be drawing on standard musical scale I will use that. For information on what they are from a music theory perspective check [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_and_minor). 

A few good chords to use that will work with the Major and Minor scale very well at any point will be the following:
```supercollider
TODO: Chords I, IV, V, (ii)
TODO: Explain why these envelopes are long.
```
The chords I, IV and V are fundamental parts of the vast majority of chord progressions in major or minor scales, with chord ii also being very common. If you randomly play these four chords over a random melody of the same (major/minor) scale, it'll sound _pretty_ good:
```supercollider
TODO: slow chords over random melody
```

### ChordSymbol - chord notation in SuperCollider

If you have a specific set of chords you would like to play using Patterns, the [ChordSymbol addon](https://github.com/triss/ChordSymbol) by triss is a great way to do this, with the chords in arrays I specified in the previous section replaced by a dictionary of chord names, which are automatically translated into their note values. This is very useful if you're working with an instrumentalist and you're not too quick in translating numbers to named chords (which I am not)
```supercollider
TODO: jazz chords
```

### Chromatic Scales

### Microtonal/Alternative scales

SuperCollider has a bunch of built-in scales (which can be found by evaluating `Scale.directory`), all of which can be used in patterns by using them as part of the `\scale` argument.

```supercollider
TODO: using microtonal scales
TODO: list the 53-tone pitch smear here
```

### Alternative tunings

SuperCollider also has a bunch of built-in tunings (which can be found by evaluating `Tuning.directory`). These are specified as part of the `scale` argument after the scale that is used. 

```supercollider
TODO: do tuning example, and also check whether or not all tunings can be done with all scales because i legit can't remember
```

### Harmonic (overtone) series

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music)):

> A harmonic series is the sequence of sounds where the base frequency of each sound is an integer multiple of the lowest base frequency

I generally use the Harmonic Series in SuperCollider by setting a fundamental (base) frequency as a NodeProxy and referring other NodeProxies to it. This way all of the playing elements can follow the same fundamental frequency, and the fundamental frequency can be modulated.

```supercollider
TODO: Detailed example of fundamental frequency/modulation etc.
```

The 'sound' of the harmonic series is different to scales, as the further up the harmonic series is played (or the more times the fundamental frequency is multiplied), the closer the intervals 'sound' to each other:

```supercollider
TODO: A harmonic series that runs from 1-30 evenly
```

This can be changed by changing the granularity of the multiplication of the fundamental frequency:

```supercollider
TODO: Changing the granularity of multiple frequencies
```

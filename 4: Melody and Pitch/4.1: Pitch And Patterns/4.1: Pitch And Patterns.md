# Pitch and Patterns

### A preamble - How is pitch handled?

There are a number of different ways to arrange pitch - a brief history of pitch.

For some context, my musical background is in the western classical music tradition, but I regularly use non-'standard' pitch arrangement techniques in my music.

### How Patterns handle pitch

Most times I'm specifying pitch for a synth or sound I will be specifying it as part of a Pbind. Pbinds are set up to handle pitch using the `freq` argument of a SynthDef, with various Pbind arguments designed to 'plug in' to create various kinds of pitch structures:

`freq` can be used to specify a raw frequency value, and `detune` is added to it: 
```supercollider
TODO: Specifying raw pitch with detune
```
`scale`, `octave` and `degree` work together to easily give the ability to use scalic pitch arrangement inside of a Pbind, for example:
```supercollider
TODO: scale/oct/degree pitch
```
Pattern classes work within Octave and Degree to create scale patterns, and arrays can also be used to create chords:
```supercollider
TODO: chords
```

It's important to note that the degrees of a scale start from `0` when using patterns, with `(0..7)` being a full octave of a major or minor scale.

    - 1/4/5, chords
    - 53 note scale and granular pirch smearing
- harmonic series, Pkr and modulation
